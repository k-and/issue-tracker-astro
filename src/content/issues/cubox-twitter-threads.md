Add support for Twitter threads in Cubox, similar to the implementation in Readwise Reader.

## Expected Features
- Capture entire Twitter threads
- Preserve thread context and formatting
- Easy navigation through thread content
- Thread author and metadata preservation
- Option to save specific tweets from a thread

## Reference
Readwise Reader's implementation can serve as a good example of how this feature should work.
