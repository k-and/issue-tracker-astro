BookFusion currently lacks a dedicated field for the publication year of books. This makes it difficult to organize and filter books by their publication date.

## Expected Behavior
- A dedicated field for the publication year in the book metadata
- Ability to sort and filter books by publication year
- Option to import publication year data from external sources
